Questions in levels with built in leaderboard

It was basically a digital treasure hunt organized as a part of technical fest of our college whose web development was done by me with this project.

You may try questions based totally upon your general awareness but as a developer i m sure you can see how Sessions are used so an applicant may not jump level by simply changing url

On can check a special feature added in this that when we enter wrong answer an image from server is popped up and conveying the same in a different and funny manner.

Special Leaderboard facility helped a lot in our judging citeria I m sure one can use that module in many projects.
